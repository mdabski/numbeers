<h2>About NumBeers</h2>
<p>NumBeers was created to help solve the problem of managing the Office Keg. It tracks the number of pours taken from the keg currently on tap. Previously, it was a very manual process. Each person would or would not enter their extension when pouring a pint. Once the keg was finished, users were matched with their extensions, totals were caluclated, price per pour calculated, and then a bill was generated.</p>
